##Embodied Data Augmentation System

This model serves the purpose of envisioning the (1) conceptualisation and (2) actualisation process (i.e. prototyping) of a product to be used to test a hypothesis for academic research. The main concept of this product is meant to capture, convert and feedback physiological data back to the user, in which case:
-	"Embodied Data" refers to physiological data from the human body captured by a wearable device.
-	"Augmentation" refers to the idea of converting subconscious embodied data into haptic feedback to the user.
-	Haptic feedback in Design refers to the use of touch to communicate with users beyond explicit information.
Further details of the context are provided in the Requirements section of the model.
