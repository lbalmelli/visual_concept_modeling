This modeling prototype seeks to develop a concept for a bike attachment that triggers traffic lights when a biker approaches them. The attachment connects to a companion app on the user's phone. The app contains a map screen that visually displays the user's trip path, a list screen that displays the date of past trips, and a settings screen to connect the app to the device. The traffic light trigger does not automatically change the light to green. Instead, it works the same was as a pedestrian pressing the traffic light trigger button. The device wirelessly signals that the cyclist is approaching so that the light can turn green quicker. This can greatly reduce travel time by reducing stoppage time. In countries with high-functioning bike infrastructure like the Netherlands, the bike traffic light may instantly turn green. This makes biking more enjoyable since the biker does not have to waste energy returning to pre-traffic light velocity.
